Description of HW6: 

After choosing cluster 13 as the cluster of interest, I determined the top 4 most upregulated genes using a wilcox test and a volcano plot. After determining this list, I researched their function and specific expression in certain cell types using Protein Atlas. I found that all of the top 4 highest expressed genes (IGKC, JCHAIN, IGHG1, IGHG2) are present in lymphoid breast tissue and most of them are markers markers of breast cancer. This would make sense as lymph nodes are present in metastatic cancer pathways and the upregulation of these genes could indicate the presence of cancerous cells. With this trend I determined that the cells in cluster 13 are likely cancerous lymphatic breast cells.
